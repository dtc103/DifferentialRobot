# Differential Robot

## Parts
- DC Motor (without encoding) 2x
- IMU (GY 521)
- ESP32
- LIPO 3.7V
- DC-DC converter (for 3.7V to 5V or 9V for motors)
- Cables

## Software
- Micro-ROS

## Tasks
### Motor Calibration
No knowledge about motor speed -> calibrate them to run the same speed

## Ideas
Here are ideas that come up when I am sleeping or in random moments
- IR LED for possible camera tracking
- Magnetometer for more precise direction control
- Kalman Filter for multi sensor integration
